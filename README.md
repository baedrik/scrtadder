# Simple Adder

This is a quick and dirty modification to the counter template so that instead of incrementing the counter, it adds a specified amount using {"add": {"amount": 24}}

Just like the original counter, it should be instantiated with {"count": 1000}

and can be reset with {"reset": {"count": 10}}
